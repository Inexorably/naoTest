# naoTest

Evolutionary learning to stabilize a NAO robot in the Webots simulator.

The population of organisms (controllers) learn to use the robot's upper body and left hip + left ankle roll to stabilize the robot while a motion plant moves the right leg and left ankle pitch to attempt to destabilize the system.
